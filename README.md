## Hodor app
### Description (A demo app to learn React-Native and nodeJS)
A react Native application which consumes endpoints from an expressJS API and few other 3rd party APIs.
Find the backend API [here](https://github.com/sghosh968/hodor-api).
I haven't decided exact use of this application yet. For now it just CRUD for Todos with user authentication using JWT. Something really cool to be added.

### Boilerplate code
